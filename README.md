# google_homepage

# A basic HTML/CSS styling project used to recreate the google homepage
# Totally non-functional this was an excercise in styling a replica using only html, css, and the browser developer tools.

# Had a little trouble getting a few things centered either horizontally or vertically and had to resort to googling some answers, 
#   otherwise it all went rather smoothly!!
